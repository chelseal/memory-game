The expected memory game logic applies for this application where the user tests their memory by seeing if they can match all identical images within a certain number of turns.

## 3. Agile Project Management in Notion (Kanban framework)

- Plan
  - Decided to collab and build a vanilla JS project
  - Chose application idea (original idea was complex so we changed to card images)
  - Researched build approaches
- Design
  - Discussed what elements and events were needed
- Develop
  - Built out game functionality
  - Got code working
  - Tweaked UI
- Test
  - Manual Testing

_In wanting to further personalise the app we..._

- Added some fun features and culled those that wouldn't add value
- Divided and built out new features using Notion
- Tweaked UI
- Did more manual testing _(todo)_
- Hosted the game _(todo)_

  git pull origin main
  ```

  - You will see - Already up to date if your repo are in sync or see the changes
    <br>

- Need to make a new branch?

  ```
  git branch your-branch
  ```

- Go to your branch and pull from local main repo

  ```
  git checkout your-branch
  git pull
  ```

- To receive the changes from main branch

  ```
  git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main su
  ```

- Submit the changes

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "write your comments"
  git push origin your-branch
  ```

- If you push your changes successfully, you will see **Compare & pull request**
  - You want to push it to main
  - Pull Request - Complete the form
  - Click **Create pull request**
